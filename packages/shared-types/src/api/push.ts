/**
 * The GENERAL in-app push channel — actionable prompts such as the approve-to-send email notification
 * over WhatsApp. Deliberately SEPARATE from the call-ring token (`RegisterCallPushTokenRequest` in
 * `./calls`), which is a PushKit/FCM VoIP token owned by the native call layer.
 *
 * The two platforms register DIFFERENT token types, on purpose (confirmed on-device 2026-07-17):
 *   - Android registers a RAW FCM device token (`getDevicePushTokenAsync`). The prompt has to arrive as
 *     a DATA-ONLY FCM message so that, when the app is backgrounded, expo-notifications' native receiver
 *     runs and attaches the Approve/Deny buttons. Expo's push service ALWAYS synthesises an FCM
 *     `notification` block on Android, so a push sent through it is delivered notification-type and the
 *     OS auto-displays it with NO action buttons. The only way to a backgrounded actionable notification
 *     is to send raw FCM v1 data-only ourselves — which needs the FCM device token, not an Expo token.
 *   - iOS registers an Expo push token (`getExpoPushTokenAsync`); Expo→APNs delivers actionable
 *     categories there. (iOS is a later, credentials-only add; the contract is ready for it.)
