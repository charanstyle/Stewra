 * One registered Stewra Runner install — a process on the user's OWN machine (a laptop, or a cloud VM they
 * own) that hosts coding agents and runs them against the user's repositories.
 *
 * Modelled on `BridgeDevice` (and on WhatsApp's "Linked devices" screen) for the same reason: the user's
 * ability to SEE every machine that can run code for them and kill any of them instantly is the strongest
 * safety property in the design. The runner's token is never included here — it is shown once, at pairing.
 *
 * `online`, `harnesses`, and `workspaces` are runtime facts reported over the socket (`runner:hello`);
 * `online` in particular is composed at read time from who is actually connected, not a stored flag that
 * could go stale after an unclean disconnect.
